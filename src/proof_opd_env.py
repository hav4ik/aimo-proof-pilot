Your final solution to the problem should be exceptionally comprehensive and easy-to-follow, which will be rated according to the following evaluation instruction:

```txt
{EVALUATION_RUBRIC}
```

In fact, you already have the ability to rate your solution yourself, so you are expected to reason carefully about how to solve a given problem, evaluate your method according to the instruction, and refine your solution by fixing issues identified until you can make no further progress.

In your final response, you should present a detailed solution to the problem followed by your evaluation of that solution.
- To give a good final response, you should try your best to locate potential issues in your own (partial) solution according to the evaluation instruction above, and fix them as many as you can.
- A good final response should just faithfully present your progress, including the best solution you can give, as well as a faithful evaluation of that solution.
- Only when you fail to locate any issues in your solution should you score it with 1.
- If you do notice some issues in your solution but fail to resolve them with your best efforts, it's totally ok to faithfully present the issues in your final response.
- The worst final response would provide a wrong solution but lie that it's correct or claim that it's correct without careful error checking. A better version should faithfully identify errors in the solution. Remember! You CAN'T cheat! If you cheat, we will know, and you will be penalized!

Your final response should be in the following format:

## Solution // Your final solution should start with this exact same markdown title
... // Your final solution to the problem here. You should try your best to optimize the quality of your solution according to the evaluation instruction above before finalizing it here.

## Self Evaluation // Your evaluation of your own solution above should start with this exact same markdown title

Here is my evaluation of the solution: // Your analysis should start with this exact same phrase
... // Your evaluation here. You are required to present in detail the key steps of the solution or the steps for which you had doubts regarding their correctness, and explicitly analyze whether each step is accurate: for correct steps, explain why you initially doubted their correctness and why they are indeed correct; for erroneous steps, explain the reason for the error and the impact of that error on the solution. You should analyze your solution faithfully. E.g., if there are issues in your final solution, you should point it out.

Based on my evaluation, the final overall score should be:
\\boxed{{...}} // where ... should be the final overall score (0, 0.5, or 1, and nothing else) based on the evaluation instruction above. You should reach this score ONLY AFTER careful RE-examination of your own solution above

- If the solution is generally correct, but with some details omitted or minor errors, then the score is 0.5

    return f"""You are given a "problem", "solution", and "solution evaluation", and you need to assess whether this "solution evaluation" is reasonable.

First, "solution evaluation" is generated to evaluate the quality of the "solution", by prompting a verifier with the rules below (these are not your rules):

```
{EVALUATION_RUBRIC}
```

Next, I will introduce the rules for you to analyze the quality of the "solution evaluation":
1. Your task is to analyze the "solution evaluation". You do not need to solve the "problem", nor do you need to strictly assess whether the "solution" is accurate. Your only task is to strictly follow the rules below to evaluate whether the "solution evaluation" is reasonable.
2. You need to analyze the content of the "solution evaluation" from three aspects: Step Restatement, Defect Analysis, Expression Analysis, and Score Analysis.
3. The most important part is Defect Analysis: check whether the errors or defects of the "solution" pointed out in the "solution evaluation" are reasonable.

You should rate the "solution evaluation" with:
- 1 if the evaluation's defect analysis and final score are reasonable.
- 0.5 if the evaluation is generally useful but has minor issues.
- 0 if the evaluation is misleading, ignores major issues, fabricates defects, or gives an unreasonable final score.

Your output should follow the format below:

Here is my analysis of the "solution evaluation":
... // Your analysis here.

Based on my analysis, I rate the "solution evaluation" as:
\\boxed{{...}} // where ... should be a numerical rating of the "solution evaluation" (0, 0.5, or 1, and nothing else) based on the criteria above.
